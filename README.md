# cybersource-rest-samples-csharp

This repository contains C# sample code for the CyberSource REST API which demonstrate C# integration with the cybersource-rest-client-csharp.

The samples are organized into categories and common usage examples, just like our API Reference Guide. Our API Reference Guide is an interactive reference for the Cybersource API. It explains the request and response parameters for each API method and has embedded code windows to allow you to send actual requests right within the API Reference Guide.


## Using the Sample Code

The samples are all completely independent and self-contained. You can analyze them to get an understanding of how a particular method works, or you can use the snippets as a starting point for your own project.

You can also run each sample directly from the console application.

## Running the Samples From the Console App
* Clone this repository:
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/khaaldrogo/cybersource-rest-samples-csharp.git
```
* Build the solution.
* Run the App via Visual Studio or you can directly run the executable file: cybersource-rest-samples-csharp.exe present in the bin folder.
* The Console App will open and give the list of all the sample codes.
* To run any specific sample code, write the name of that sample code and press enter key.
